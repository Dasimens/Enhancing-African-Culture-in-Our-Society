                <h1>A Deep Dive into Yoruba Culture</h1>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Yoruba are one of the largest and most culturally rich ethnic groups in Africa. Primarily found
                    in southwestern Nigeria, they also reside in parts of Benin, Togo, and a significant diaspora
                    population exists in the Americas due to historical migration and the transatlantic slave trade.
                    Yoruba culture is known for its elaborate belief systems, vibrant arts, traditional governance,
                    festivals, and deep communal values. The Yoruba are a people with a profound sense of identity,
                    history, and pride in their heritage.
                </p>

                <h2>Language and Oral Tradition</h2>
                <p>
                    The Yoruba language, part of the Niger-Congo family, is spoken by over 20 million people. It is a
                    tonal language with three basic tones—high, mid, and low—which can alter the meaning of words.
                    Language is deeply tied to Yoruba identity, and it plays a central role in storytelling, religion,
                    and cultural ceremonies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oral tradition is a core element of Yoruba culture. Proverbs, folk tales, praise poetry, and
                    historical narratives are passed from generation to generation through spoken word. These oral forms
                    not only preserve history but also serve as tools for teaching morals, wisdom, and social values.
                </p>

                <h2>Religion and Belief System</h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional Yoruba religion is centered around a supreme deity, <strong>Olódùmarè</strong>, and a
                    vast pantheon of deities known as <strong>Òrìṣà</strong>. Each Òrìṣà governs different aspects of
                    the natural world and human life. Examples include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shango</strong> – god of thunder and lightning</li>
                    <li><strong>Ogun</strong> – god of iron and war</li>
                    <li><strong>Yemoja</strong> – goddess of rivers and motherhood</li>
                    <li><strong>Esu</strong> – the divine messenger and trickster</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The Ifá divination system, guided by a priest known as a Babalawo, is used to consult the divine for
                    guidance. Although many Yoruba today practice Christianity or Islam, traditional beliefs are still
                    widely respected and practiced, often blended in syncretic forms.
                </p>

                <h2>Family and Social Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    Yoruba culture places strong emphasis on family and community. Families are typically extended, with
                    grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins playing significant roles. Respect for elders is deeply
                    ingrained; children are taught to greet and serve elders with deference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Social roles are well defined, and there’s a communal spirit of cooperation. Ceremonies such as
                    naming, marriage, and burial involve the extended family and wider community. The
                    <strong>compound</strong> or household unit is an important social structure, often hosting multiple
                    related families.
                </p>

                <h2>Traditional Governance</h2>
                <p>
                    Yoruba society historically developed complex systems of governance, with cities and towns led by
                    kings known as <strong>Oba</strong>. The Oba is considered sacred and rules with the help of a
                    council of chiefs and elders. Notable Yoruba kingdoms include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ile-Ife</strong> – regarded as the spiritual and historical origin of the Yoruba people
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Oyo Empire</st>
